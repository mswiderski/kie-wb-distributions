Installation notes
==================

1. Define system properties

    create setenv.sh (or setenv.bat) file inside TOMCAT_HOME/bin and add following:

    CATALINA_OPTS="-Xmx512M -XX:MaxPermSize=512m \
    -Djava.security.auth.login.config=$CATALINA_HOME/webapps/kie-wb/WEB-INF/classes/login.config \
    -Dorg.jboss.logging.provider=jdk"

    NOTE: On Debian based systems $CATALINA_HOME needs to be replaced with $CATALINA_BASE. ($CATALINA_HOME defaults to /usr/share/tomcat7 and $CATALINA_BASE defaults to /var/lib/tomcat7/)
    NOTE: this is an example for unix like systems for Windows $CATALINA_HOME needs to be replaced with windows env variable or absolute path
    NOTE: java.security.auth.login.config value includes name of the folder in which application is deployed by default it assumes kie-wb so ensure that matches real installation.
        login.config file can be externalized as well meaning be placed outside of war file.
